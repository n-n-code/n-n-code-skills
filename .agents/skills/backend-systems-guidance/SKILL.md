# Backend Systems Guidance

This is a composable overlay, not a standalone workflow.
Use alongside the repo's implementation skill when the change touches backend
code.

This is the canonical backend overlay in this repo.
It extends the thin baseline `backend-guidance` overlay with stronger guidance
for non-trivial service boundaries, repositories, reliability, and trust
boundaries.

Prefer it over `backend-guidance` when the task includes new endpoints or
consumers, multi-layer refactors, repository or transaction work, auth or
trust-boundary logic, or backend review that needs explicit testing and
reliability checks.

Use the bundled references only when needed:

- [references/trigger-evals.md](references/trigger-evals.md) for lightweight
  prompt checks when revising the trigger or scope

## When to use

- the repo has server-side networked code such as HTTP handlers, gRPC methods,
  webhooks, queue consumers, or message producers
- the task adds or reshapes routes, controllers, services, repositories,
  middleware, or request-processing boundaries
- the task changes auth, authorization, validation, idempotency, retries,
  external requests, caching, or observability
- the task needs backend review beyond basic handler thinness, especially for
  security, data access, or missing tests

## Not for

- HTTP client code, CLI tooling, offline batch scripts, or data pipelines with
  no request or consumer boundary
- frontend-only work
- threat modeling or security audit work where `security` should be the primary
  workflow skill

Do not fold infrastructure deployment workflows, outbound-client-only guidance,
or full security-audit checklists into this skill. Keep this overlay centered
on backend request and consumer systems plus their immediate reliability and
trust boundaries.

## Core workflow

1. Read the touched backend files and map the request or consumer path end to
   end: boundary, service logic, data access, external calls, and state
   changes.
2. Pick the mode before changing code:
   - baseline backend change when the work is mostly a thin handler or small
     service fix
   - service-boundary change when responsibilities, data access, or dependency
     direction may need to move
   - reliability-hardening or review mode when the main risk is missing tests,
     auth gaps, retries, observability, or unsafe failure handling
3. Keep the boundary thin: decode input, authenticate and authorize, validate,
   call a service, map transport errors, and serialize output. Business
   decisions belong in service code that can run without the transport layer.
4. Place persistence and external integrations deliberately:
   - repositories or data adapters own query shape, batching, and transaction
     details when that improves clarity or testing
   - services coordinate business rules, idempotency, retries, and side-effect
     ordering
   - handlers and controllers do not reach directly into ORM or network clients
     unless the change is truly trivial and stays trivial
5. Harden cross-cutting concerns at the edge:
   - validate external input once at the boundary
   - enforce auth and authorization before business actions
   - set timeouts, retry rules, and destination allowlists for outbound calls
   - use structured logging, correlation identifiers, and explicit error
     mapping for observable failure paths
6. Choose the smallest test set that proves the change:
   - unit tests for service logic and decision branches
   - integration tests for handlers, consumers, repositories, and transaction
     behavior
   - auth and permission tests for protected flows
   - contract or schema tests when the change alters external API or event
     shapes
   - load or concurrency tests only for changed hotspots, queue throughput, or
     latency-sensitive paths
7. Review the result for boundary leaks, unsafe defaults, data-access
   inefficiency, and missing verification before finishing.

## Decision rules

- Start with `backend-guidance` for ordinary backend edits. Use this overlay
  when the task needs stronger design pressure, harder review, or explicit
  backend quality gates.
- Keep handlers thin in responsibility, not by literal line count. If a
  handler or consumer owns business decisions, retries, transaction branching,
  or query orchestration, extract inward.
- Keep business logic transport-free. If testing a rule requires booting HTTP,
  gRPC, or queue infrastructure, the logic is in the wrong place.
- Add a repository or data-access interface when it reduces duplication,
  isolates non-trivial queries, helps transaction composition, or makes tests
  materially simpler. Do not add one for single-call trivial CRUD.
- Prefer one validation pass at the outer edge plus typed internal data. Avoid
  repeated validation in every layer unless a trust boundary changes.
- Treat retries as a design choice, not a default. Only retry idempotent or
  explicitly deduplicated work, and pair retries with deadlines or backoff.
- Use idempotency keys or duplicate-detection for retried creates, webhook
  handlers, and queue consumers that can be re-delivered.
- Every outbound request needs a timeout and failure policy. For user-controlled
  destinations, apply allowlists or equivalent SSRF protections.
- Keep error handling explicit: domain code returns or throws domain-level
  failures; boundary code maps them to HTTP, gRPC, queue, or job semantics.
- Measure before adding caching. Cache only stable read paths with clear
  invalidation or bounded staleness.

## Validation

A backend change is done when, in addition to the base implementation skill's
validation:

- handlers or consumers stay as boundary glue and delegate business decisions to
  testable service code
- data access and external I/O live behind clear seams when the change is
  non-trivial
- external input, auth, and transport-specific error mapping stay at the edge
- retries, idempotency, timeouts, and failure handling are explicit where the
  change can duplicate work or call remote systems
- tests cover the changed behavior at the correct level, including integration
  coverage for boundary behavior and permission or failure cases when relevant
- new high-risk paths emit enough evidence to debug production behavior
